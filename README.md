# fMRI-Volumetric-Renderer
A volumetric fMRI renderer for the web. Built using WebGL.

This project presents a method for visualizing volumetric MRI and fMRI data based on a discrete raytracing algorithm and OpenGL.
Data is pre-processed and then attached to the html template document. The renderer itself is written in html.
